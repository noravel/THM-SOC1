TTP is an acronym for  Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

+ The  Tactic  is the adversary's goal or objective.
+ The  Technique  is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
+ The  Procedure  is how the technique is executed.

**MITRE ATT&CK** is a framework that maps out how attackers actually operate - it's 
like a playbook of real-world hacking techniques.

# Tacticss (The "Why")
The goals an attacker wants to achieve:
+ Initial Access - Getting into the system
+ Execution - Running malicious code
+ Persistence - Stay hidden in the system
+ Priviledge Escalation - Getting higher permissions
+ Defense Evasion - Avoiding detection
+ Command & Control - Communicating with their servers 
+ Exfiltration - Stealing data

# Techniques (The "How")
+ The specific methods used to achieve each tactic:
    + Under "Intial Access" -> Phishing email

# Procedures (The "What")
The exact implementation by specific threat groups
