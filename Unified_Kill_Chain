# Unified Kill Chain (Extension of Cyber Kill Chain)

## Key Differences from Cyber Kill Chain:

- Adds more granular phases (18 vs 7 phases)
- Better addresses modern attack patterns
- Includes more feedback loops

**3 Main Phase:**

- Phase: In (Initial Foothold)
    - Reconnaissance : gather information relating to target
    - Weaponization: setting up the necessary infrastructure to perform the attack.
    - Social Engineering: techniques that an adversary can employ to manipulate employees to perform actions that will aid in the adversaries attack.
    - Exploitation: take advantage of weaknesses or vulnerabilities present in a system.
    - Persistence: maintain access to a system they have gained an initial foothold on.
    - Defense Evasion: understand the techniques an adversary uses to evade defensive measures put in place in the system.
    - Command & Control: combine the efforts an adversary made during the “weaponization” stage of the UKC to establish communications b/w the adversary and target system.
    - Pivoting: reach other systems within a network.
- Phase: Through (Network Propagation)
    - Discovery: uncover information about the system and the network it is connected to.
    - Privilege Escalation: Gain more prominent permissions within the pivot system.
    - Execution: deploy malicious code using the pivot system as the host
    - Credential Access: Steal credentials
    - Lateral Movement: seek to move through the network and jump onto other target system.
- Phase: Out (Action on Objectives)
    - Collection: gather all the data of interest.
    - Exfiltration: steal data by using encryption and compression to avoid detection.
    - Impact: manipulate, interrupt or destroy assets
    - Objectives: seek to achieve their goals with all the power and access.

## When to Use:

- Unified: More detailed analysis, modern attacks
- Cyber: Simple communication, traditional attacks
