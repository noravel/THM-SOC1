# Pyramid of Pain

![alt text](~/Desktop/pyramid.jpg)

The higher up the pyramid, the more pain it causes attackers to change their approach.

- Hash Values (Trivial): 
    + Hash values are used for malware identification. Each malware file has a unique has fingerprint (MD5, SHA1,SHA256).
    + Security tools can quickly block known malicous files by comparing their hashes against databases of known bad files.
    + Attackers can bypass this by making changes to their malwares => completely change the hash. 

- IP address (Easy): 
    + IP address is used to identify any device connected to a network.
    + IP address is considered "easy" because attackers can quickly change them by renting new servers, or use different infrastructure.
    + IP address can be valuable for immediate blocking and understand attack patterns. 

- Domain Names (Simple):
    + Domain name is like mapping an ip address to the name that easy for human to remember.
    + Punny code? is a way of converting words that cannot be written in ASCII, into a Unicode ASCII encoding.
    + To detect malicious domains, proxy logs or web server logs can be used. 
    + what is proxy server? a router that provides a gateway between users and the internet â‡’ prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network.
    + Attackers hide the malicious domains under URL shorteners. => make it harder for users to sopy malicious domain
    + Domain name request: DNS request
- Host Artifacts (Annoying):
    + Host Artifacts are traces left on the infected computer include registry keys created or modified, 
    file dropped in specific folders, services started, log entries. 
    + These are "annoying" because they're harder for attackers to change
    
- Network Artifacts (Annoying):
    + Network Artifacts are patterns in network traffic that indicate malicious activity including
    unsual port usage or protocols, C2 patterns 
    + These require more effort for attackers to modify since they need to change how their malware communicates. 

- Tools (Challenging):
    + These are software/frameworks attackers use such as Metasploit, RATs
    challenging => developing new tools require time and expertise
- TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):
    + TTPs are the methods and behaviors of attacks
