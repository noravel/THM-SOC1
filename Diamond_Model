## Core Diamond Elements (Traditional)

### 1. Adversary

- **Primary Actor**: Individual or group conducting the intrusion
- **Adversary Customer**: Entity receiving benefits from the intrusion
    - May be the same as primary actor (self-benefit)
    - Could be nation-state, criminal organization, competitor
    - Payment/benefit relationship with primary actor

### 2. Victim

- **Victim Persona**: Human targets
    - Executives, IT administrators, end users
    - Social engineering targets
    - Insider threats (unwitting or complicit)
- **Victim Assets**: Technical targets
    - Hardware: Servers, workstations, mobile devices, IoT
    - Software: Applications, databases, operating systems
    - Data: Intellectual property, credentials, financial records

### 3. Capabilities

- **Technical Skills**: Programming, exploit development, social engineering
- **Operational Skills**: Reconnaissance, persistence, evasion
- **Tools Proficiency**: Ability to use specific malware, frameworks, utilities
- **Knowledge Domains**: Understanding of target environment, protocols, vulnerabilities

### 4. Infrastructure

- **Type 1 (Adversary-Owned)**
    - Command & Control servers
    - Domain registrations
    - Hosting services
    - Communication channels
- **Type 2 (Intermediary/Compromised)**
    - Compromised legitimate websites
    - Hijacked domains
    - Compromised third-party services
    - Botnet resources

## Contextual Elements

### 5. Timestamp

- **Attack Timeline**: Date and time of activities
- **Dwell Time**: Duration between compromise and detection
- **Campaign Duration**: Start to finish of operation
- **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Expected operational window

### 6. Phase (Cyber Kill Chain)

- **Reconnaissance**: Target identification and information gathering
- **Weaponization**: Exploit and payload development
- **Delivery**: Transmission of weapon to target
- **Exploitation**: Triggering of exploit
- **Installation**: Malware installation on target system
- **Command & Control**: Establishing persistent communication
- **Actions on Objectives**: Data exfiltration, lateral movement, impact

### 7. Direction

- **Host-Based Events**: Activities occurring on individual systems
    - File system modifications
    - Registry changes
    - Process execution
    - Local privilege escalation
- **Network-Based Events**: Activities involving network communication
    - Traffic analysis
    - Protocol anomalies
    - Lateral movement
    - Data exfiltration patterns

## Resource Elements

### 8. Adversary Arsenal

- **Exploit Inventory**: Zero-days, known vulnerabilities, exploit kits
- **Malware Collection**: Custom tools, off-the-shelf malware, living-off-the-land binaries
- **Social Engineering Assets**: Personas, pretext scenarios, credential databases
- **Infrastructure Resources**: Servers, domains, certificates, proxies

### 9. Methodology

- **Attack Framework**: Systematic approach to conducting operations
    - MITRE ATT&CK techniques
    - APT-specific playbooks
    - Criminal organization procedures
- **Operational Security**: Methods to avoid detection and attribution
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and validation procedures for tools/techniques

### 10. Resources (Enabling Factors)

- **Financial**: Funding for operations, infrastructure, personnel
- **Human**: Team size, skill diversity, organizational structure
- **Technological**: Computing resources, development environments, testing labs
- **Informational**: Intelligence gathering, target research, vulnerability databases
- **Temporal**: Time available for operation planning and execution
- **Facilities**: Physical locations, secure communications, operational security

## Outcome Elements

### 11. Result

- **Primary Objectives Achieved**
    - Data exfiltration success/failure
    - System compromise level
    - Persistence establishment
- **Secondary Effects**
    - Reputation damage
    - Financial impact
    - Operational disruption
    - Regulatory consequences
